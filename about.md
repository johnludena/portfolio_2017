My name is John Ludena and I’ve been **building websites and web applications professionally for over 6 years** – the last 3 working as an independent freelance contractor.

In that time, I’ve built countless web properties for companies ranging from brand-new startups – all the way to large corporations. I’ve not only gotten the chance to work with some extremely talented teams, but also learn from some smart and savvy business owners.

It’s been one _hell_ of a ride.

But as much as I enjoy the freedom and flexibility that comes with being a freelancer and working with various teams, **I’m looking for a change of pace in 2016 and looking to join a new team full-time.**

Do you think I’d be a good fit for your company? Excellent! Feel free to [check out my portfolio](/portfolio). If you like what you see, [shoot me a message](mailto:jludena@boldpixelmedia.com). I’d love to hear from you.

Only need a quick consultation to get your project back on track? No problem. <a href="https://clarity.fm/johnludena" target="_blank">Schedule a call with me</a> through Clarity.fm and only **pay by the minute.**

Put my experience to _work for you_ and let’s grow your business like never before in 2016.
