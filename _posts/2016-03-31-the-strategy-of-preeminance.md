There&#8217;s a legend in the marketing world known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Abraham" target="_blank">Jay Abraham</a>. His business tactics and philosophy to grow businesses in every industry out there has proven so effective, he&#8217;s been dubbed &#8220;The Billion Dollar Man.&#8221;

At the core of Jay&#8217;s ideology is what he calls &#8220;<a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/jayabrahamassets/Documents/The-Strategy-Of-Preeminence1.pdf" target="_blank">The Strategy of Preeminance</a>,&#8221; a way for you to become your client&#8217;s most trusted advisor.

Notice I said client, not customer. There&#8217;s a big difference.

Customers by nature are fleeting. They come and go. Maybe they&#8217;ll buy something from you one time, and you&#8217;ll never see them again. If we were talking in hookup lingo, customers would be your one-night stands.

Clients on the other hand are the equivalent of a long term relationship. You act as their most trusted advisor, and they in return keep coming back to you to meet their business needs throughout their LIFETIMES.

You see, at the very core of &#8220;The Strategy of Preeminence&#8221; is the idea of always doing what&#8217;s best for your client and giving massive value up-front – before any money changes hands. This in turn, builds a trust and rapport from your client that no amount of money can buy. A trust that turns into a business relationship that goes way past a one-time transaction.

For example, pretend you contact me for a web project in a special niche and I replied with this: &#8220;I&#8217;d love to work on this project with you. However, I think you&#8217;d be better off with company XYZ. They are super knowledgeable in your particular niche and would have much better chance at knocking this one out of the park.&#8221;

What would you do?

I don&#8217;t know about you, but if somebody told me that with 100% honesty and no other hidden agenda, I&#8217;d have no choice but to be impressed by their sincerity and would keep them in mind when I needed honest advice or help in the future.

This would in the end, result in a loyal client for life. And isn&#8217;t that something that all successful businesses share? Loyal clients that keep coming back time, and time, and time again.
