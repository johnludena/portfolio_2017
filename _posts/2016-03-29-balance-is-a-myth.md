Today I was reminded of the fragility of life. How we can be here one day, and gone the next.

It makes me question everything sometimes. At least in regards to my goals and plans for the future.

Should I spend the next 10, 20, 30 years pursuing the life of my dreams&#8230; and risk leaving this world in the process without having enjoyed myself at all?

Or do I live like everyday could be my last, with no plans for the future or setting large and ambitious goals that could make a difference in the lives of lots of people before my time is up?

It&#8217;s a gamble either way. I believe the Greeks had a name for these two kind of life philosophies: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism" target="_blank">Stoicism</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicureanism" target="_blank">Epicureanism</a>.

Stoics would be the people who didn&#8217;t mind sacrificing today to reap the rewards of their work tomorrow. They lived their life with a sense of duty to all human beings&#8230; and believed that their efforts would be compensated in the after-life by becoming &#8220;gods&#8221; based on how virtuous their lives were.

On the other hand, Epicureans believed that life was fleeting, and you should enjoy each and every day like it was your last. They didn&#8217;t believe in an after-life. They simple thought that once you are gone, you are gone – and you should live your life accordingly, because there is no do-over. They basically adopted a &#8220;YOLO&#8221; mentality, like the kids might say.

Which one is right?

In the perfect world, neither one. Life is supposed to be about balance.

The Yin and Yang symbol represents this concept well. Life is supposed to be about a balance between the good and the bad. The light and the dark. Living recklessly everyday, vs having a vision and plan for what your future could look like&#8230;

But is this really achievable? I think balance has always been a bit of a myth. A false promise that self-help &#8220;gurus&#8221; sell you on so you can buy their books.

It&#8217;s all just a mirage in the end.

It&#8217;s impossible to find balance. The only thing you can do is pick a side and hope for the best.
