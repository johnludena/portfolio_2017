I’m in the Web Design business. What I do for my clients on a daily basis is to help them put their business on the map of this crazy digital world we call the Internet.
  
But that’s not my real passion as I’ve recently discovered. My real purpose and what drives me to do this job to the best of my abilities is helping somebody along in their path to Entrepreneurship.

You see – I believe that deep down inside everybody has that Entrepreneurial spirit that’s just bursting to come out.

I love the challenge and personal growth that comes with taking this path. Most of all, I am head over heels in love with the _process_ of building thing for the web.

Taking a website through all the phases like mockups, design, development, testing and finally ­launching it for the world to see – that’s what I love about what I do.

As weird as it may sound, sometimes I think that’s probably in some small way what it feels to be parent watching your kid grow up and leave the nest. They are born, you raise them to the best of your abilities, and finally ­– you have to let them go and see how they develop as individuals and hope they become a productive member of society.

That’s the real exciting part for me. Seeing what your online baby can turn into.

If I had to create one of those popular blog posts with a list of things, mine would be called “The 5 Core Beliefs that I’ve Forged in My Entrepreneurial Journey” and would consist of the following:

  1. I believe that we all have an inner Entrepreneur just waiting to be released into the world.
  2. I believe the path to Entrepreneurship is a path of self-discovery and growth.
  3. I believe in leading by example and showing people that becoming a successful Entrepreneur is not something only a few privileged minds can achieve.
  4. I believe in in building things that provide value for others should be your #1 priority if you want to achieve success online.
  5. I believe that when you fall in love with the process, it’s like watching a kid grow. Sure it’s lot of work, but you know you are making the world a better place because of it.

Those are my personal beliefs. What are yours?
