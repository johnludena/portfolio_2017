  Back in 2009, my family and I went on a vacation tour alongside the East Coast. The trip lasted about a week and it was one of the most memorable times of my life. Starting at the very top east corner of the United States, we arrived by plane in New York City to start our tour of the country by heading south, not before the obligatory NYC walk through Times Square and other must-see places of course. Along the journey we stopped at several historic landmarks such as downtown Philadelphia to tour the US Mint, Washington D.C. and the beautiful National Mall, which strange enough, was the only place that didn’t have a gift shop. Get it? It’s a “Mall”? <a href="http://youtu.be/hLv4afpovvA?t=53s" target="_blank"><em>Play me off Johnny!</em></a>

  As we made our way back up north for the fly back, we passed through the beautiful city of Boston, making stops at MIT and the Boston Market, as well as visiting the West Point Military Academy in West Point, NY. West Point campus was amazing. You can feel every bit of history and tradition in that place. And the view. Jesus. There’s a particular place on West Point affectionately called “The Million Dollar View” where students can look at the incredible scenery of the Hudson River between small mountains. I have to say, I wouldn’t mind studying in a place like <em>that.</em>

  Once back in NY, we started going upstate, towards Niagara Falls. If you’ve seen a picture of the Falls, I don’t think I need to tell you how amazing they are in person. And even better at night when the lights come on. It’s a really unique experience. I always heard that the view is even more amazing from the Canadian side (<em>lucky Canadians!)</em>, but we didn’t get a chance to get the necessary passports to cross to the other side before starting the trip. Bummer.

  The place that stuck with me most of all though? A house called “<em>The Breakers” </em>in Newport, Rhode Island. “<em>The Breakers” </em>was the Summer home of the Vanderbilt family, one of the richest families in the history of the US. The house is huge and ostentatiously decorated, something the minimalist in me didn’t particularly find appealing, but it was quite fascinating touring through it anyways. I learned about the “hidden” hallways throughout the house which servants had to sneak through in order to stay out of sight of the Vanderbilt family or their guests, and other rich-folk eccentricities.

  The one place in the entire house that stopped me dead in my tracks was their <em>front yard. </em>The house’s front yard is about the size of a <em>football field. </em>And the view. My God. The Vanderbilts had the freakin’ Atlantic Ocean as their water view.

  Something inside of me changed that day. As I stood on their stupidly big balcony overseeing this majestic view, I started thinking about what life might have been like being a member of the Vanderbilt family. Waking up every morning, brewing up a cup of the finest coffee money can buy, and walking to your balcony to greet the day with a gorgeous view. I am not a jealous person by nature, but part of me really was envious of this lifestyle. Something deep inside of me really wanted to experience this at some point in my lifetime. Perhaps not the garish decorations of what I like to call “old-rich”, but to be able to experience this kind of view on a daily basis, where you could wake up, open your bedroom window and see this “Billion Dollar View” as I’ve dubbed it. Thanks West Point.

  Part of me felt guilty though. Was it wrong to want something more when you have so much compared to other people? After all, I have a beautiful, supportive family, I have my health, and I’m not starving by any means. You see, my family and I have always been very much middle class. I’ve never felt I didn’t have enough growing up as both my parents worked their tails off to provide for me and my brother growing up. However, as I got older, a fire inside of me started forming. It talked to me on a very deep level. It felt like somebody inside was saying: “You are supposed to have abundance in your life, not struggle every day to make ends meet.” Reading the popular book “<em>The Secret” </em>by Rhonda Byrne helped this mentality solidify itself, but I wouldn’t say it necessarily caused it. It was on that balcony in Newport, looking at that blue ocean, when my <em>soul </em>recognized something in that moment and said “This is more like it!”. And when you feel something so powerful deep down inside you, you gotta listen to it and see where it takes you.

  So it was at that precise point in my life, back in 2009, when I realized I <em>didn’t </em>want the American Dream. The house in the suburbs with the white picket fence was not <em>my </em>cup of tea. <em>I wanted something more. I wanted to live my own dream. </em>I decided right then and there that I would work my butt off every single day from that point on to achieve something bigger. Much bigger.

  Is my dream owning a home like the Vanderbilt’s? Not really. I have a small circle of friends and that’s how I like to keep it. Big houses are for people who love “entertaining” or have large families in my opinion. I don’t love or have either. However, I do want to aim for something big like it. “Shoot for the moon, even if you miss you’ll land among the stars.” This is my new mantra. My “dream stupidly big and see what comes out of it” mentality. I don’t want to aim for something realistic anymore. Why put a constraint in your mind that a small house in the suburbs should be the most to aspire to? The hell with that. I want “Billion Dollar Views” and a front yard to play football in.
