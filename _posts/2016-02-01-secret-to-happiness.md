  One of my favorite books of all time is “<a href="http://amzn.to/1nzVHeE" target="_blank">The Alchemist</a>” by Paulo Coelho. There’s a wonderful story inside the book that talks about a young boy who learns the secret of happiness from a wealthy king. And the story goes a little something like this&#8230;

  A young boy gets an opportunity to visit a King’s castle – a marvelous castle that’s known for it’s incredible riches and wonderful decorations. The King who lives there is the richest man in the land, and upon arriving, the boy is greeted by a flurry of trade activity inside the castle walls. Tradesmen from all over the country are there to talk to the King and ask for his advice.

  The boy takes his place in line for his chance to talk to the King. After waiting for hours, he finally gets his chance. The boy goes up to the king and finally gets the courage to ask: “My lord, what is the secret to happiness?” The king smiles and tells the boy: “That is not a simple answer young lad. I still have to attend to all these other people that have come to see me, but I will make you a deal: Why don’t you take a stroll through my castle and admire its beauty? By the time you’ve come back, I’ll be ready to give you the answer you seek.”


  The boy beamed and started walking away, but then the King stopped him: “Before you go, I want you to do something for me. Take this spoon filled with a rare oil from my private collection. I want you to make sure not to spill a drop while you walk around the castle.” The boy agreed, confused, but not daring to question the King.

  As he started walking through the castle, the boy was so worried about not spilling the oil in the spoon, that he walked very slowly with his head down and his eyes firmly focused on the spoon. After a few hours, he finally returned to see the King.

  “Well? What did you think of my magnificent castle?” asked the King. “My lord… I’m afraid I didn’t really see it. I was too afraid of spilling the oil in this spoon.” “What is that you say? You mean to tell me you missed the exquisite paintings on my domed ceilings? The gardens that took 10 years to cultivate? The glorious view of the mountains as you walk through my balcony? Go back again and wonder at the marvels of my world.”

  So the boy did. This time he saw it all. The paintings, the gardens, the mountains.  Fine tapestries and exotic animals. It was the most amazing place the boy had ever seen.

  When he finally came back to see the King, he was beaming from ear to ear. “I see you finally experienced my wonderful castle, but what happened to the oil in the spoon I entrusted you?”

  The young boy came out of the day-dream he found himself in, looked down on the spoon… and his heart sank. He had spilled all the oil that the King gave him.

  The King kindly put a hand on his shoulder, looked him straight in the eye and told him:

  <strong>“The secret to happiness is to see and experience all the marvels of the world, but <em>never</em> forget about the oil in your spoon.”</strong>

## Let’s never forget about the precious oil in our lives

    Sometimes we are so focused on the big picture of success, that we tend to forget about the oil in our spoon. The oil could be anything:

  <ul>
    <li>
      Spending time with your family instead of working 12 hours a day
    </li>
    <li>
      Going out to eat without worrying about a stupid diet
    </li>
    <li>
      Hanging out with old friends instead of “having” to be at the gym
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We all have certain long term goals of wealth, health, relationships. And sometimes we work so hard to achieve them, we tend to shut the rest of the world off and miss all the wonders that life can give us.
  </p>

  <p>
    I know I’m definitely guilty of this. That’s why one of my goals this year is to keep working towards all my goals, but never forget to keep an eye out on my spoon.
