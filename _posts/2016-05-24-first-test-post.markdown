Hello there. This is my first ever test post. And guess what? It's made with the very 
cool Jekyll "CMS" â€“ a static website generator that is making waves and kicking it old 
school for leaner, FAST sites that are maintenance-free.

So, the question is, can Jekyll replace Wordpress as the CMS of choice for most Web 
Designers and Developers? I take Jekyll for a spin to find out.

## Conclusion

Wrapping it up. Should you try it? Yes or no.
