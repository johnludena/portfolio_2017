title: My Coding Bootcamp Experience&#58; Week 1 in Review

Today marks the end of my first week at [The Iron Yard](http://www.theironyard.com), a 12-week 
accelerated program to become a real front-end engineer (aka 
front-end developer), and be able to build more advanced websites and web applications without having to rely on a CMS (i.e. Wordpress) or an external plugin. Something you need to be able to do if you want to work with any serious software company.

First of all, if you are considering attending a bootcamp, I can tell 
you that it's not for the faint of heart. The program moves _extremely_ 
quickly, and will leave you in the dust if you are not paying attention 
at all times – on top of putting in the extra hours at home.

In average, most coding bootcamps expect you to put no less than 40 
hours a week (but most students average between 60 to 80 hours).

There's no sugarcoating it: You will live and _breath_ code for 3 months (dreams of the command line started yesterday for me), and 
unless you are mentally and physically ready, you'll have a hard time getting your money's worth 
out of the course and might struggle to get a job after graduation.

And coding bootcamps don't exactly come a dime a dozen. [The average cost for attending a bootcamp in the USA seems to be around the $11,063 mark](https://www.coursereport.com/reports/2015-coding-bootcamp-market-size-study), which is a bit less than what I'm paying to attend The Iron Yard Houston and complete their 
"Front-End Engineering" course this summer ($13,900 is the current tuition cost).

Of course, like any other education program, there's several financing options you can look at if you are interested in attending. I've chosen to go through [Climb Credit](http://www.climbcredit.com), an institution that works closely with The Iron Yard.

The bulk of the front-end course is Javascript (which we will be starting 
next week), but this first week has included a few pleasant surprises 
where I learned new things about HTML & CSS I never knew. Or never quite understood completely.

The other pleasant surprise was getting that chance to learn from a young and very talented teacher by the name of Justin Richards - an extremely talented coder and teacher who wears cowboy boots, rides a BMW motorcycle, and wears Harry Potter 
glasses – and somehow makes it all _look good_.

Thinking about attending The Iron Yard yourself? Well, that's why I decided to 
start this series. To cover everything we learned in class, including my 
personal thoughts about what went great for me, and some of my personal 
struggles.

So without further ado, I present to you...

## The Iron Yard: Week 1 in Review

Week 1 was an enjoyable week. As every course or education program 
should be treated, the first week at The Iron Yard was an easy week 
covering the basic foundations that every good web developer needs 
today.

Some of the topics we covered in class were:

### 1. Intro to Terminal

We got to learn the basics of how to use the Terminal 
(the command line on a Mac) in order to power-through actions – instead of being 
slowed down by a GUI (Graphic User Interface) like the Finder or an FTP client. Not to 
mention that certain key services like Git can only be used from the 
Terminal.

### 2. Basics of HTML/CSS:

It'd be impossible to build anything for the web 
without first understanding the basics of HTML & CSS, which are the core 
pillars of any website. Luckily for me, I've always had a good 
understanding of these, but I was re-introduced to some handy tricks and "hacks" that modern web devs use to tackle common issues like:

* Empty space between divs or columns (fixed by setting the
<code>body</code>'s <code>font-size</code> to 0 in your CSS)
* Preventing an element's total width from expanding as you increase its 
padding or border size with the <code>box-sizing</code> property.
* An increased understanding of exactly how the tricky 
<code>position:absolute</code> works – and how to use it confidently without 
completely breaking everything else around it.

### 3. Intro to Git & GitHub

For the longest time, I thought these 2 terms meant the same thing.

Not so much as it turns out.

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a **code repository**, where 
you can store your code to give you powerful _version control_ features 
(a must-have for when things go terribly wrong and you need to go back to your previous version), not to mention the 
ability for multiple team members to collaborate on the same project and 
same files – without overwriting each other's changes all over the 
place.

[GitHub](https://github.com/) on the other hand, acts more like a **free hosting service for developers** who want to share their open-source code with the world. Like 
everything else in life, it has its pros and cons. The biggest pro would 
be you'd get access to incredible fast and reliable FREE servers that 
power the world's most popular code repos in the world. The downside is 
that by using the service, you are OK with sharing your code freely with 
other developers to use as they see fit.

The entire Git & GitHub community is based around the core idea of sharing the cool 
things you build with other devs, and keep moving the web forward. Two 
things I'm all about.

### 4. Responsive Design:

The final topic we covered in class was 
responsive design. As Justin told us: "If your website or app doesn't 
look good on a mobile device, no serious company is going to hire you."

Words of wisdom indeed. I think we've gone past the point in time where 
you even need to ask "Does this look good on my phone?" It should be 
_assumed_ already that whatever you are building, you are considering 
responsive design **throughout the entire process,** and not as an 
after-thought.

Just as with HTML & CSS, I'm well-versed with responsive design methodologies (although I wouldn't say I'm a complete expert), so this topic was more like a review than anything else in my case.

## Wrapping up Week 1

I had a lot of fun this first week. I tried to help my fellow students 
as much as possible with their HTML/CSS questions, got to learn about 
two new "power-user" tools like Terminal and Git, and wrapped it all up 
on Friday by playing a little [drawful](http://jackboxgames.com/tag/drawful/) on the projector while having a few beers and working in our responsive product grid assignment.

I'm super excited to get into the real meat of the course though: 
Javascript. I'll write another post at the end of Week 2 with some 
thoughts after our first week tackling the basics of JS and everything else covered in class.

See you in the future.
