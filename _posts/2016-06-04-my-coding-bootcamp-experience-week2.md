Here we are. Two weeks down in my first ever coding bootcamp experience at The Iron Yard.

And wow. What a week it's been.

This week we got introduced to Javascript and **real, logic-based programming**. Which is quite different from just plain HTML or CSS.

I like to think of HTML & CSS as just a painted picture that the browser serves you. Javascript on the other hand, has the power of making this picture interactive, based on the user's input and actions.

I'm not going to lie to you. Going from a design background to learning my first real programming language, has been a wake-up call. 

And that's because coding in HTML or CSS doesn't really require much thought before you get to work. You simply have a layout, and you use the proper markdown and CSS styles to replicate that layout.

Programming in Javascript (and other languages I'm guessing), has a very different process. You first need to UNDERSTAND the problem, then – and only then – should you start tackling your first line of code.

And trust me, sometimes the problem can take a while to understand and figure out how to translate those steps to a computer. Much more time than coding the solution actually takes.

Luckily for me, our instructor's advice and guidance on how to **tackle a problem by writing it down step-by-step on paper first**, has been invaluable so far.

Want to know more about all the topics we covered in class? Well, say no more...

## The Iron Yard: Week 2 in Review

Our introduction to Javascript consisted of the very basics of any programming language: variables, functions, <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> statements, <code>while</code> loops, and my personal go-to: the <code>for</code> loop.

### Javascript basics

The core of our work this week was writing several different functions. We started things off fairly easy, writing functions to get the average of two inputs, using <code>boolean</code> operators to check whether an input is a <code>string</code>, <code>number</code>,  or neither – as well as the obligatory checking one value to another using <code>if</code> statements and <code>for</code> loops (one of those must-have tools to cycle automatically through a big list of inputs that are inside an <code>array</code> of data).

### Turning up the heat

Things quickly starting getting hot and heavy in the Javascript world mid-week, as we started tackling much more complex problems. Some of the highlights were:

* Finding the GCD (greatest common denominator) of two numbers
* Outputting a reversed string of characters
* The infamous "fizzbuzz" game (apparently a favorite in coding interviews)

## Wrapping things up

Even though I felt overwhelmed in the beginning, after constantly practicing and re-doing several of the exercises in our homework, I'm feeling more confident in my abilities as a future front-end engineer.

I honestly can't wait for Week 3 to start, and with some luck, we'll be tackling some real-world Javascript problems that are directly related to the things every front-end developer experiences on a daily basis.

Until next time...
