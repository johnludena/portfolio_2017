The year is already half-way over, and so is the coding bootcamp I'm attending this summer at [The Iron Yard](http://www.theironyard.com) Houston.

My oh my.

It's been _such_ a busy 3 weeks, that I've fallen behind my regularly scheduled weekly update for anybody who is considering attending a coding bootcamp now or in the future.

So, before doing anything else this morning, I want to catch you up with our progress lately.

## The Iron Yard: Week 4, 5, and 6 in Review

### Week 4

Week 4 was an incredible week as we finally got introduced to API's and making data requests to a third party to finally start dynamically outputting data on our HTML pages (something I was looking forward to since week 1)

One of our homework assignments was creating a "rollodex" of Congressmen with their full contact details, all taken by using the Sunlight Foundation API – an online project to make politics more transparent and allow people to have easier access to key data about the people that represent them in Congress.

Another fun assignment that weeks was creating a clone of a GitHub's user profile by using GitHub's own API.

### Week 5

In week 5, we jumped in the deep end of the pool and finally got introduced to the modern standard that most web applications use today: The **Model, View, Controller** pattern, or MVC for short.

MVC is what all web apps use today to create a seamless experience that doesn't require loading screens or sluggish-feeling apps. What users get instead, is a more fluid experience, as if they were looking at local bunch of files (and not files hosted thousands of miles from where their location).

And this magic happens because the MVC pattern allows you to build **Single-Page Applications** (SPA) by using only ONE html page that Javascript modifies to create multiple pages – instead of having multiple HTML pages, browser requests, and page refreshes.

It's really a thing of beauty to see a SPA in action. And chances are you've used AT LEAST one at some point in the past 12 months. The # at the end of the URL is usually a tell-tale sign that you are viewing a single-page application. Not to mention the load-less screens (the Views) that you get every time you click on something.

I'm not going to lie to you though. MVC may seem easy to understand, but once you start breaking down each part, it can get a _little_ overwhelming. That's why it's so important to **keep your code organized and make sure all your naming conventions are on point**, otherwise you might find yourself lost in the forest of your own Javascript.

During week 5, we also got introduced to our first tool in the MVC world: [Backbone](http://www.backbonejs.org).

Backbone is a popular Javascript framework that helps make your MVC pattern easier, especially when it comes to the MV part of it (models and controllers).

### Week 6

Probably the most fun I've had so far during my bootcamp experience was this past week learning React, the state-of-the-art Javascript framework created by the web dev team at Facebook.

We are still using Backbone for our controller and models, but we've integrated React for all of our views, since there are some very cool things you can do with React that you can't exactly do with Backbone (e.g. writing native HTML in JSX, etc.)

## Conclusion

It's incredible to think that just 3 weeks ago I knew nothing about how modern web apps work at their core, and now I can build my very own.

I'm incredibly excited to keep building things with Facebook's React framework, as well as keep learning new tools that all modern web devs use on a daily basis.
