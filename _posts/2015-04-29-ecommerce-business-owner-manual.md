If you&#8217;ve always wanted to sell a product online and build a real business around it, but have absolutely no clue where to even get started – this is the guide for you.

On this page, I&#8217;ve compiled a list of some of the best resources and tools out there today and put together a step-by-step guide of how to start building your very first ecommerce business today.

Let&#8217;s get started, shall we?

## 1. Do your (niche) research

Choosing the wrong ecommerce niche before getting started is like trying to go up on an escalator that only goes down. You will have to exert superhuman effort if you want to get to the very top.

Do yourself a favor and set your business to have the best chances for success by first doing some proper market research before even thinking about launching your first online store.

## 2. Choose a brandable business name and register its domain name

Picking a good name is a bit of an art. Your new business (and domain name) should be short, sweet, easy to spell, and highly brandable.

After you have your new awesome name, register it with <a href="/hover" target="_blank">Hover</a>. They are my all-time favorite registrar company due to their incredibly simple (and honest) approach to domain selling – compared to other companies like GoDaddy that constantly try to up-sell you and make managing your domain MUCH more complicated than it needs to be. I guess they need to pay for all those Super Bowl ads somehow.

Pro-tip: Make sure it&#8217;s a dot com domain name. If your name is taken, try adding a branding number to your name such as <a href="http://www.refinery29.com/" target="_blank">Refinery29</a>, or <a href="http://www.fivefourclub.com/" target="_blank">FiveFourClub</a>. In 2015, branding is more important than keywords in your domain name. Just make sure to remember that.

## 3. Choose the right ecommerce platform for your needs

There are a million shopping carts out there. Some are good, others are bad, most are plain ugly. Choose wisely because this could cost you a lot money down the road – but more importantly – your sanity if you choose the wrong platform.

&nbsp;

### MY MOST RECOMMENDED ECOMMERCE PLATFORMS (FULL REVIEW ON EACH PLATFORM COMING SOON):

<a href="/bigcommerce" target="_blank">Bigcommerce</a>: Hosted platform means less tech headaches. Incredible value for powerful features such as live shipping quotes (even on the cheapest plan). Usability issues in the admin backend hurt the overall experience. Limited templates.

<a href="/shopify" target="_blank">Shopify</a>: Hosted platform. Beautiful templates. Extremely polished and user-friendly with a premium price to match. Live shipping requires $179/mo. plan (ouch). Good for simple store categories/products setup. Unintuitive category setup can turn into a nightmare for more complex stores.

<a href="http://www.squarespace.com/" target="_blank">Squarespace</a>: Hosted platform. Fantastic visual tool for building websites. Simple ecommerce features allow you to sell any product even on their most affordable plan at $8/mo. Not the best choice if you need more advanced features that other ecommerce platforms come bundled with, but perfect for selling simple products (e.g. eBooks or t-shirts).

<a href="http://www.wordpress.org/" target="_blank">WordPress</a> + <a href="http://www.woothemes.com/" target="_blank">WooCommerce</a>: Self-hosted solution (no monthly fees) on your own server space with a popular small business host like <a href="/bluehost" target="_blank">Bluehost</a> or other provider. Open-source (i.e. free) WordPress and WooCommerce core software. Thousands of ecommerce templates to choose from. Major customization will require a WordPress developer (they are not hard to find thankfully). Wordpress software upgrades and maintenance need to be done by you to prevent security issues.

&nbsp;

## 4. Test your niche with a dropshipping model first

Pre-buying inventory before you even test your e-commerce niche is madness. Don&#8217;t spend a penny on inventory. Use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shipping" target="_blank">drop shipping business model</a> instead. If you are creating your own products, create awesome mockups that will make your customers believe these products actually exist. If you need an example, check out my <a href="http://www.safetycanvas.com/" target="_blank">safety posters</a> ecommerce store – none of those products exist. I just mocked them up in Photoshop.

If you are not designer, use a service like <a href="http://www.fiverr.com/" target="_blank">Fiverr</a> and get professionally designed product images for the cost of a cup of coffee. <a href="http://www.elance.com/" target="_blank">Elance</a> is also a good choice (although be prepared to pay MUCH more than just $5).

&nbsp;

## 5. Get a dedicated phone number for your business

People like talking to other people to re-assure them that they are indeed doing business with a real company. Get yourself a free <a href="http://www.google.com/voice" target="_blank">Google Voice</a> number and put that in at the top of your website. Make sure you forward that to your cellphone. On your phone, save that Google Voice number as a contact that reads &#8220;Your Business Name.&#8221; This way you have a clear reminder when an incoming call to your cellphone is personal, and when it&#8217;s a business call.

Pro-tip: Want to look and sound Fortune 500? For about $12/mo, you can get a 1-800 number from a service like <a href="/grasshopper" target="_blank">Grasshopper</a> that forwards to your cellphone. Afterwards, get somebody from Fiverr to record a professional phone greeting for only $5 – instead of paying Grasshopper $85 for their in-house talent.

&nbsp;

## 6. Use smart pricing strategies

If you bought anything in your lifetime, you know that you&#8217;ll rarely see round numbers and that&#8217;s because there&#8217;s a deeply rooted psychological reason why we are more inclined to buy a product for $49, but not at $50.

Also keep this in mind: Free _anything_ will always have a big impact on our buying decisions.

Since Amazon arrived on the scene, most shoppers online now expect free shipping on their purchases. Make sure to factor this into your pricing strategy and offer free shipping when orders hit a certain amount in order to get people to spend a bit more before checking out (i.e. free shipping on orders over $200).

## 7. Spread the word to your tribe

Social media is a quick and easy way to start spreading the word out on your new business. Not the most effective way (unless you have a large following), but it&#8217;s a great start.

However, getting people to check out your stuff in a noisy world is a very tricky game that you need to learn how to play – or risk getting completely ignored. Remember it&#8217;s not all about you.

The whole point of social media is to get SOCIAL! Connect with other people, comment on their links and updates. Start building relationships so they&#8217;ll grow interested in checking out your profile, visiting your website, and sharing your own links. Go by the 80/20 principle. For every 8 honest interactions you make on social media, promote your business 2 times.

Makes sense right?

&nbsp;

## 8. Blog until your fingers bleed

If you don&#8217;t have a business blog&#8230; goodnight sweet prince.

You will be doomed to failure in the eyes of Google.

You need constant, fresh, epic content that pertains to your niche or you will never drive organic traffic (i.e. non-paid traffic). Learn how to write or hire a copywriter. If you want to learn from the best (and got the cash for it), I HIGHLY recommend you sign up for the <a href="/damnfinewords" target="_blank">Damn Fine Words</a> course by my former teacher James Chartrand.

And in case you can&#8217;t quite afford $1600+ to work one-on-one with one of the best in the biz, [Udemy](http://www.udemy.com/) has plenty of self-guided copywriting online classes for much more affordable prices.

Let me tell you from personal experience that choosing to learn the fine art of copywriting has been one of the greatest investments I&#8217;ve EVER made. Some people argue <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2013/03/11/the-only-essential-skill-you-need-to-be-successful-online/" target="_blank">copywriting is the only essential skill you need to be successful online.</a>

I&#8217;m inclined to agree.

Now, if the thought of writing your own content and blogging brings back bad memories of you pulling all-nighters to turn in writing assignments during school&#8230; do yourself a favor and just hire a writer to take care of it. Preferably one that specializes in content marketing. I gotta warn you though, a good copywriter is not that easy to find – nor cheap. Elance and <a href="http://www.upwork.com/" target="_blank">Upwork</a> are good places to look.

&nbsp;

### GREAT COPYWRITING BLOGS WORTH CHECKING OUT (IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER):

<a href="http://www.copyhackers.com/" target="_blank">Copyhackers</a>

<a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/" target="_blank">Copyblogger</a>

<a href="http://www.menwithpens.ca/" target="_blank">Men With Pens</a>

&nbsp;

## 9. Learn some SEO basics

SEO is the whip cream to your copywriting frapuccino. One just makes the other that much better.

SEO is also an art and it will take some time to study and become a master of it like anything else in life. However, please don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the end all, be all. Creating content should still be the base of your frapuccino drink. After all, who the heck only wants whip cream on their frapuccino?

As stated above, if your budget allows for it, hire a professional to do it for you. This is also not as easy as it sounds. Pretty much everybody claims to be an &#8220;SEO specialist&#8221; nowadays. Check out <a href="http://www.elance.com/" target="_blank">Elance</a> for potential candidates and look at their reviews to see what kind of feedback they&#8217;ve gotten over the past 12 months.

&nbsp;

## 10. Buy traffic

Hands down the best way to quickly drive traffic to your website and validate your new niche. <a href="http://www.google.com/adwords" target="_blank">Google AdWords</a> is still champion by a mile long, as everybody and their seeing-eye dog uses Google to search for stuff nowadays. Although the recent marriage and birth of the <a href="http://bingads.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Yahoo-Bing Ad Network</a> (two search giants combining forces to defeat almighty Google) may offer some great bang for your advertising buck as well. Try them out if your budget allows for it.

&nbsp;

## 11. Track everything

Time to test everything. Your AdWords conversions. Your visitors&#8217; store flow. Your goal conversions. Use AdWords Goal Tracking, <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a>, and <a href="http://www.google.com/webmaster" target="_blank">Google Webmaster Tools</a>.

&nbsp;

## 12. Make changes constantly

Today&#8217;s ecommerce business must be flexible and ready to change courses quickly. As Bruce Lee famously said: &#8220;Be like water my friend.&#8221; Use everything you&#8217;ve learned from analytics and conversions and make changes you think will improve the business. Re-test everything.

Look up some of the highest converting and most successful online stores. Copy their layout and strategy. Picasso said it best: &#8220;Good artists borrow. Great artists steal.&#8221; Leverage a large company&#8217;s marketing and research efforts in your favor and follow their footsteps. Obviously they shouldn&#8217;t be in your same market if you did your research properly, unless you are ready to fight tooth and nail for every sale.

&nbsp;

## 13. Profit and delegate

Once you start making more than 10 sales a week, follow a page from Tim Ferris and his Entrepreneurial classic<a href="http://amzn.to/1Mt5NV2" target="_blank">&#8220;The 4-Hour Workweek&#8221;</a> and outsource anything that can be outsourced. Customer emails, forwarding orders, issuing refunds, etc. Keep taking care of creating content, promoting your new business, and coming up with new growth strategies.

&nbsp;

## 14. Take a long vacation in Thailand

Once you start making serious coin by having at least 50+ sales a week, you should now have enough to hire real talent that will continue to promote your brand as if it was theirs. Hire a really good copywriter and SEO specialist by this point if you haven&#8217;t done so.

Take a month off. You deserve it after building this new empire of yours. I hear Thailand is always nice this time of the year. Going <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitesurfing" target="_blank">kitesurfing</a> in the morning and sipping Mai-Thais in the evening sounds nice, doesn&#8217;t it?

Don&#8217;t stress about a thing. Everything will be just as your left it when you come back if you setup all your systems the right way.
