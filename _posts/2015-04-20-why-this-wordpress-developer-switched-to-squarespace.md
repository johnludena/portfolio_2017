OK, I might lose my "Developer card" for this one, but I need to get something off my chest:

I’m sick and tired of dealing with WordPress.

There, I said it.

Yes, WordPress is a fantastic tool that can be used to create almost any type of website. And yes, there's one of the most amazing and helpful communities out there willing to help a brother (or sister) out when they have a question on how to get WordPress to behave a certain way.

That;s not what I don;t like about WordPress.

That's actually what I _love_ about it and why 80% of the websites I've built over the past 6 years are all powered by it.

But not anymore. At least not for what I&#8217;m personally trying to accomplish in 2015 – which is not to be just a successful Web Designer & Developer – but to be a successful _business owner._

And for any newly established business that relies on growth by people finding you through Google, the mantra is this: Put out good content or die tryin&#8217;.

And yes, that means writing more – something you can&#8217;t do if you are dealing with technology all day.



## Let's admit it: Wordpress is a bit of a diva.

I am sick and tired of WordPress and its constant attention seeking from me in order to keep it happy and healthy.

WordPress has become a sort of _needy girlfriend_ for me.

For example, the other day I was writing a new tutorial for [my Ecommerce blog](http://www.ecommercetutorial.net) – an article that would bring in new traffic and potential revenue – when I get this doozy of an email from my host:

![Screenshot of email sent by Bluehost stating that my site will probably explode.]({{ site.url }}/assets/wp-super-cache-email.jpg)

Well, there goes finishing that tutorial. I'll be concerned for the rest of the day reviewing my list of clients to see if they are using the WP Super Cache plugin on any of their websites, in case their host is not as helpful as [Bluehost](/bluehost) and could risk getting hacked and their business being redirected to Viagra-happy places.

I know things like keeping plugins updated only takes but a few minutes to do. That&#8217;s not the point. The point I&#8217;m trying to make is that it distracts you from the bigger picture: **growing your business.**

## The Great Squarespace Experiment

This &#8220;Come-to-Jesus&#8221; moment made me realize that I spend _way_ too much time and energy dealing with WordPress on a daily basis.

And that&#8217;s what prompted my move to a hosted platform like <a href="http://www.squarespace.com" target="_blank">Squarespace</a>.

I’ll be conducting a 6-month experiment to see if migrating from WordPress to Squarespace encourages me to deal less with technology and focus more on writing epic shit for the Internet. I&#8217;m not talking about writing the Next Great American novel here – I&#8217;m simply talking about writing for real, measurable business results – or **copywriting**, as the cool kids call it.

So far, the move to Squarespace has been one smooth ride.

First of all, I selected a beautiful, minimalistic template that would put my content front and center. It took exactly 5 minutes after browsing through Squarespace&#8217;s elegant templates and picking one that would fit the bill.

The next step was to bring in all my old blog posts from WordPress. Squarespace has two ways of doing this: one through a WP XML file that you import into Squarespace (meaning that you first need to go into WP and export it), or simply use their tool to connect to your WordPress site remotely and download all content. I went this route and the process went through without a glitch.

Next on the list was making some slight changes to certain pages like the homepage. I just have to say that it&#8217;s so nice not to have to switch back and forth between WordPress&#8217; pages content, posts content, widgets content, forms content, etc.

_Sooo_ nice.

Every piece of editable content is right there staring at me in visual form on the right hand side. If I want to edit any section of it, I simply click on it and type away.

The final step was simply pointing my domain to Squarespace&#8217;s servers. Not a big deal at all. Squarespace works with my all-time favorite domain registrar <a href="http://hover.evyy.net/c/152638/150221/2799" target="_blank">Hover</a>, and provides you with step-by-step instructions to change the necessary DNS records on your domain name from inside your Hover account.

A few hours go by and I casually type in my website on my iPhone to see if all DNS records have taken effect. I&#8217;m greeted by my new mobile Squarespace website and it&#8217;s a thing of beauty. Those talented bastards over at Squarespace have built one sleek &#8220;slide-out&#8221; navigation for this template.

It&#8217;s buttery-smooth and I love it. (While secretly wish for bad Voodoo stuff to happen to Squarespace designers for being that damn talented).

## Going forward

Squarespace and I are still in the honeymoon phase as you can tell. Time will only tell if we end up together – or if I&#8217;m forced to file for divorce because this sexy thing is all looks and no substance.

I&#8217;m _really_ hoping that&#8217;s not the case.

That&#8217;s why I won&#8217;t be posting a follow up to this anytime soon. My plan is to really put the platform to the test and see how everything works and how easy (or hard) it may be to upgrade its core functionality as my needs change over the next 6 months.

I&#8217;m not just interested in seeing how easy it is to post content either.

I&#8217;m also looking to see how well Squarespace gets along with Google. In other words, how well the platform has been built for SEO and search engine love.

Only then will I post a follow up on this post.

I&#8217;d love to hear from folks who have made the switch. Have you tried Squarespace? Did you love it or hate it? Perhaps the old saying of &#8220;Once you go WordPress, you never go back&#8221; true for you? Post a comment below with your experience.

And if you&#8217;ve been thinking about pulling the trigger and moving from WordPress to Squarespace as well but are still undecided – leave your question below and I&#8217;ll answer it to the best of my abilities from what I&#8217;ve learned so far.
