So, by some miracle of search engine results you have arrived here. And maybe, <em>just</em> maybe, you feel inclined to leave a comment on my blog…


Only to find out I have (intentionally) turned off all comments.

<p>
  Why exactly did I decide to do this you may ask yourself? And more importantly, should <em>you</em> leave comments off on your blog if you are also trying to get better at blogging on a more consistent basis?
</p>

<p>
  Well, the reason is quite simple: I do believe having comments turned on in your blog is a great way to create a discussion around a certain topic. However, when you are just getting started trying to write on a consistent basis, I think having comments on can hinder your progress.
</p>

<p>
  Here’s why&#8230;
</p>

<h2>
  1. Managing and responding to comments can be time consuming.
</h2>

<p>
  I like to respond to each and every comment as fast as possible, so people know that I care about them enough when they take time out of their busy day to leave a comment in a stranger’s blog.
</p>

<p>
  However, I’m not exactly trying to build a community here.
</p>

<p>
  I’m just trying to write every single day. That means sitting down for one hour or so and write anything that may come to mind. Hopefully doing this enough times will make writing in other projects (i.e. blogs, landing pages, ebooks, emails, etc.) a much easier process.
</p>

<h2>
  2. Most of us are externally validated writers.
</h2>

<p>
  There’s a concept that I learned from James Chartrand when I took her excellent <a href="http://www.damnfinewords.com/" target="_blank">Damn Fine Words</a> course. And it was to understand the difference between an <strong>internally validated writer vs. an externally validated one.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  The internally validated writer gives zero fucks to put it bluntly. She writes because she likes to write. Once she is done, she steps back, marvels at her fine piece of writing and says: “Damn, that was pretty good. Let’s hit publish on this bad boy.”
</p>

<p>
  And then completely forgets about it. If people comment on it, great. If not, she doesn’t lose sleep over it. She knows she wrote a great article/post/content piece.
</p>

<p>
  That’s where I want to be. An internally validated writer.
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately, I tend to fall on the opposite spectrum. The other day I wrote a 2,000 word article on another of my blogs. I spent the better part of a full day in researching, editing, and even including images that would help explain the concept.
</p>

<p>
  Only to hear crickets in the comments section.
</p>

<p>
  Imagine doing this over and over again. Maybe a troll or two saying you completely wasted their time and to go fuck yourself for good measure. The wild wild west of the Internet can be a cruel mistress sometimes. Anonymity breeds contempt as I once heard somewhere.
</p>

<p>
  Now, I like to believe I have pretty thick skin online. You pretty much have to when you are putting yourself out there day in and day out. However, an externally validated writer can only take so much before they start giving up when they sit in front of their computer to crank out another piece of writing.
</p>

<h2>
  Baby steps is the key to gain confidence as a blogger and writer
</h2>

<p>
  And I don’t want to start giving up. You can’t expect to wake up one day and say: “You know what world, I want to write today. Let’s publish a 7-book series a la Harry Potter. It’s going to be epic!”
</p>

<p>
  You’d end up failing spectacularly and probably even going mad at some point. Lord knows that writers are already known to be on the eccentric side.
</p>

<p>
  That’s why removing as much friction as possible in the writing process is so important when you are first getting started. And turning off comments is not the only way. You could also:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Put some noise canceling headphones on with classical music to drown out the nearby Starbucks baristas
  </li>
  <li>
    Pick a good chair to sit on to prevent bad posture (I personally like single sofa chairs. Great for working with laptops).
  </li>
  <li>
    Writing first thing in the morning before your energy is drained with menial tasks throughout the course of the day.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  All of these are a way to remove potential obstacles when you are ready to write. And with less friction, you gain a bit more confidence every time you hit that “Publish” button. Which gets you a bit closer to becoming an internally validated writer.
</p>

<p>
  So, there you have it. The reason why I turned off comments on this blog. If you are struggling with blogging more often like myself, maybe you should try it as well. There’s no rule out there that says you have to leave comments on your blog.
</p>

<p>
  Do whatever works for you and your own goals.
